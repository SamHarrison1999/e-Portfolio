Under what circumstances does it make sense to use recursion?

Recursion works best when the solution is self-similar

What is the purpose of the base case in recursion?

When true, the base case stops the recursive calls and returns a value.

Assume you want to write a recursive function that multiplies each element in a list by the number 5. What should the base case be?

When the length of the list is 1

Look at the code below. Select the answer that best describes why the code is problematic.

def recursive_function(num):
    if num < 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return num + recursive_function(num)

When using recursion, num should get smaller so that the base case becomes true
