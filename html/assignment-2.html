        <h1>Evaluation of System Implementation for Autonomous Vehicle</h1>
        <p>The three systems of an autonomous vehicle that I chose to support were GPS, Auto pilot and object detection. I made two different iterations of my system implementation the first focused on using abstract classes which I then decided to get rid of when I refactored my code for the sake of simplicity. If I were to do my assignment again I would have developed a GUI, extended the object detection system to use computer vision, extended the navigation system to use the google maps API and refactored my code to take advantage of design patterns such as the singleton pattern and builder pattern but due to the time constraints I faced due to working full time whilst doing a masters I didn't have the time I would have liked to make the improvements I wanted to make.</p>
