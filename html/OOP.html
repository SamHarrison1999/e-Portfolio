        <h1>Module Reflection</h1>
        <p>Over the course of this module we covered a range of topics related to object-oriented programming in Python.</p>
        <p>The aspects of this module I found the most interesting were learning more about UML diagrams and learning about how object-oriented programming in Python differs to other programming languages.</p>
        <p>The reason learning about UML diagrams was important for me was because while I had learned about UML diagrams in the past, my knowledge of them was by no means extensive. After completing this module, I now understand UML diagrams in greater detail and have gained a greater appreciation for the significance they hold due to how they can impact the success of a project. After learning about UML diagrams throughout this module, I got to put the theory I learned into practice for my intern projects for my job at Verint as I had to make a high-level design document for both my small and large intern projects. Having completed this module significantly helped me with this as it allowed me to make higher quality design diagrams which allowed me to complete my project to a higher level.</p>
        <p>After completing the module, I significantly improved my Python programming skills. Previously I had mainly coded in Java, Angular and Groovy with a little bit of Python from my undergraduate degree. Learning Python in greater detail has made me a more well-rounded programmer. I believe it is important to understand several programming languages as when you switch jobs, the main programming language they use may differ from the one you are used to, so knowing other programming languages can make the adjustment to your new job easier. For example, at Nomura I wrote code for the backend in Java and code for the front end in Angular, whereas during my time at Verint I have mainly written bash scripts and Groovy code.</p>
        <p>Learning more about Python could be very helpful for my current job at Verint working in the release management team as we are planning on switching our pipelines from Jenkins to Harness over the next several months, and one of the things I have noticed from pipelines that have already been migrated over to Harness is that a lot of them use python scripts. Due to this migration coming up soon, having a more in-depth knowledge of Python could be vital for when we migrate to Harness as it could make the migration process a lot smoother.</p>
        <p>An area of this module where I could have done better was in the collaborative discussions as even though I did the write-up for each collaborative discussion, I never published them, the reason for this is that only two or three people that actually used the collaborative discussions I believe the main reason for this was because they were not marked. I saw little point in posting to the forum as you would get at most 2 or 3 replies. I believe a collaborative discussion is a good idea in theory, however, it can only really be beneficial if you have a lot of people posting and commenting. I read through all the posts and replies on the collaborative discussion as it is good to understand other people’s opinions, especially when they have more real world experience than me as it shows how their opinions are shaped by their experiences.</p>
        <p>Whilst a lot of the theory covered in the module was information, I already knew covering it in greater depth and from a different perspective was a good experience.</p>
        <p>As I am a kinaesthetic learner, I found the lab sessions to be a very productive way to reinforce your learning.</p>
        <p>I believe I benefited from the low attendance of the other students during the lectures as because only 3 or 4 people attended each lecture, it allowed me to ask more questions than I would have asked otherwise due to my shyness also a smaller group meant the lecturer gave greater focus to each student which I found to be helpful.</p>
        <p>Whilst during my undergraduate degree, it felt more like you were being taught how to do the assignment. This module covered a lot more concepts then it was up to me to tie it all together for the assignment. I consider this to be a good thing as it prioritises independent learning, and it will allow me to translate the knowledge I gained throughout this module throughout my career in computer science. I think it’s good to see how different lectures teaching styles differ as it helps me to better understand differences between people.</p>
        <p>One criticism I would have for this module is the use of codio as I don’t really see the point in forcing students to use codio as all the exercises and lab sessions in the module can be done on any Python IDE and you would not have the issues you have with codio. For example, codio uses python 3.6, meaning it does not support match statements whereas the latest version of Python is 3.12. Other than the compatibility issues, I am also more used to the user interface of my preferred IDE (PyCharm), which is why I would do the labs on my IDE before copying and pasting them into codio.</p>
        <p>Another criticism of the module would be that the information on the learning platform isn’t always up to date, for example, in one section it said the word count for an assignment was 1000 words, but then in the submission section it was 500 words, this is a problem as there is a 10% grade penalty for going over the word count by more than 10%. Additionally, while the lecturer was good at answering questions in lectures, sometimes emails would not be answered, this is not so much an issue when you have a lecture the next week. However, during gaps between lectures, this can be problematic. This issue is something that I have noticed across other modules as well, so maybe it’s because the lecturers get a lot of emails so miss some.</p>
        <p>I believe the whole class could have benefited from the module lecture slides being available before the lecture so they can come to each lecture with questions.</p>
