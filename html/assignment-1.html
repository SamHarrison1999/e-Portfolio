        <h1>Evaluation of System Design for Autonomous Vehicle</h1>
        <p>While I had some knowledge of UML diagrams it was very limitied. This assignment required me to create a series of different UML diagrams. The diagrams I struggled the most with were activity diagrams and state transition diagrams. The reason for this was because these were the two diagrams I had the least knowledge about. Another area I struggled with the assignment was with the write up I had struggled with the word count the reason for this is because 500 words isn't enoguh for this assignment I believe 1000 words would have been more sufficient as it woulld have allowed me to go into greater detail which would have potentially resulted in a higher mark. If I were to redo my assignment, I would have used different software and split my diagrams into multiple diagrams the reason for doing this is because my class diagram and activity diagram were a bit pixelated in my write-up document.</p>
