        <h2>What we did in unit 3</h2>
        <p>In this unit, we looked at the different UML diagrams in detail and discussed how UML diagrams are used throughout the software development life cycle.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on unit 3</h2>
        <p>After completing this unit, I had a greater understanding of all the different UML diagrams. I believe completing this unit has a signifcant impact on my grade for the design document assignment as previously I had only covered UML diagrams in brief detail so understanding them better ensured I got a better grade. Completing this unit allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of planning a project before starting it.</p>

            <h3>Summary Post</h3>
            <p>Comparing how my peers have ranked the factors that affect reuseability has allowed me to greater understand other people's thought processes. I considered this to be a good learning opportunity as you get insights from programmers with more real world experience than me. Based on the information I have learned from my peers I would rearrange my rankings to put service contracts and design patterns higher as the arguments made by my peers have forced me to reconsider their importance. For service contracts, I hadn't previously considered how contracts can prevent you from reusing code as I didn't have an in depth knowledge of the different licenses and the difference between each license such as MIT vs. GPL.</p>

        <p>Discuss which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.</p>
        <p>The different stages of the software development life cycle are; planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing and maintenance.</p>
        <p>Use case diagrams should be created as soon as you begin your project as they help to identify common activities. Use cases are part of the requirements gathering process. Use case diagrams should be looked throughout the software development life cycle. For example, in testing a use case diagram helps you know what scenarios you need to test, and for analysis, a use case diagram can be used to write user stories which can help you figure out the goals of your project.</p>
        <p>Class diagrams should be one of the first diagrams you create as they show the relationships between classes and the operations you can perform on each object. Class diagrams are helpful during the implementation phase of the software development life cycle as they detail the methods and attributes for each class. Not having any class diagrams can have a significant impact on a project as without a class diagram you could write extra unnecessary code. Class diagrams enable code reuse making your code cleaner.</p>
        <p>Interaction diagrams show the interactions between objects because of this they should be used in the requirements gathering process and testing. The most common interaction diagram is a sequence diagram that shows the interactions with a system in sequential order.</p>
        <p>Activity diagrams are used to show the flow of an application because if this they should be used during the requirements gathering process.</p>
