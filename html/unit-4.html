      <h2>What we did in Unit 4</h2>
      <p>In this unit, put the theory we learned about class diagrams in practice by creating Python applications based on class diagrams. </p>

      <h2>Reflection on Unit 4</h2>
      <p>This unit reinstated the importance of making class diagrams before writing code. Previously when I started a project I would go straight into  writing the code not really spending much time on the planning this was detrimental to the success of the project as when I would get stuck I would spend alot of time researching looking for potential solutions to a problem. In hindsight, if I had designed a detailed class diagram before starting coding I would have saved myself alot of time which would allow me to improve my project by adding additional functionality. Due to the importance placed on meeting deadlines and there are only so many hours in a day it is important to be as efficient as possible when it comes to time management and creating class diagrams helps to ensure this.</p>
